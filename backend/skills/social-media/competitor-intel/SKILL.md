# Competitor Intelligence Skill

Use this skill to benchmark the client against the market.

## Process

1.  **Competitor Identification**
    *   Identify 2-3 direct competitors.
    *   Identify 1 aspirational competitor (someone doing it amazing).

2.  **Content Audit**
    *   What are they talking about? (Topics)
    *   How are they talking about it? (Tone/Format)
    *   What is working? (High engagement posts)
    *   What is NOT working? (Low engagement)

3.  **Gap Analysis**
    *   What topics are competitors ignoring?
    *   Where is their quality low?
    *   This is the "Opportunity Zone" for our client.
