# Campaign Ideation

Generate 3 differentiated campaign concepts that are SPECIFIC to this brand.

## Process

1. **Extract Brand Website First**
   
   If you have a website URL, use the tool:
   ```
   extract_website_content(url="https://example.com")
   ```
   
   Look for:
   - What they actually sell
   - Their tone of voice
   - Their unique angle/positioning
   - Key products or services
   - Any proof points (clients, case studies, numbers)

2. **Research Context** (Tavily search)
   
   Now search for:
   - What competitors are doing on Instagram
   - What content performs in this industry
   - Current trends or pain points
   
   Example queries:
   - `"[competitor]" Instagram marketing strategy`
   - `"[industry]" B2B content marketing trends 2026`
   - `"[target audience]" pain points challenges`

3. **Generate 3 Concepts**
   
   Each concept must be:
   - **Specific**: Only works for THIS brand
   - **Insightful**: Backed by what you found
   - **Creative**: Would YOU stop scrolling?
   - **Memorable**: Has a clear angle
   
   Format:
   ```
   ## Concept: [Name - make it catchy]
   
   **Angle**: [One sentence - what's the creative idea?]
   
   **Why it works**: [Cite specific insight from your research]
   
   **Content preview**:
   - Instagram: [1-2 post ideas with actual hooks]
   - Email: [Sequence angle]
   
   **Visual direction**: [Be specific - not "modern and professional"]
   
   **Sample hook**: [Write an actual headline or opening line]
   ```

## Quality Standards

**Good concepts:**
- "The 47 AI Failures Report" → Lead with specific research you'll compile
- "Behind the Pitch" → Founder story series with raw takes
- "The Experiment Log" → Document real tests, share real results

**Bad concepts (NEVER propose):**
- "Thought Leadership" → Too vague
- "Brand Awareness Campaign" → Not a concept
- "Empowering [Audience]" → Cringe
- "Digital Transformation Solutions" → Corporate speak

**Good hooks:**
- "We analyzed 200 competitor ads. Here's what converts."
- "The strategy that 10x'd our client's demo calls."
- "Stop reading AI news. Start implementing."

**Bad hooks (NEVER write):**
- "Unlock your business potential"
- "Empowering businesses to succeed"
- "Your trusted partner for growth"

## Critical Rules

1. **Extract the website first** - No concepts without understanding the brand
2. **Back every claim** - If you say "this works," cite why
3. **Be specific** - If a concept could apply to any brand, it's too generic
4. **Write actual hooks** - Not placeholders like "[compelling hook here]"
5. **No forced geography** - Target location is for ads, not copy

## Waiting for Selection

After presenting concepts, ask:
> "Which concept resonates? I'll develop it into a full campaign."

**Do not auto-expand.** Wait for user choice.
