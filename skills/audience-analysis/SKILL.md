# Audience Analysis Skill

Use this skill to understand WHO the content is for. Do not just list demographics; find the *psychographics*.

## Process

1.  **Identify Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)**
    *   Who buys this? Focus on job titles (B2B) or lifestyle segments (B2C).

2.  **Pain Point Mapping**
    *   What keeps them up at night?
    *   What professional problems does the company solve for them?

3.  **Content Consumption**
    *   Where do they hang out online? (LinkedIn, TikTok, Industry Forums?)
    *   What format of content do they trust? (Whitepapers, Quick videos, Case studies?)

4.  **Persona Creation**
    *   Create 1-2 primary personas based on the above research.
