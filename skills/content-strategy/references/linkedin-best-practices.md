# LinkedIn Content Best Practices

## Algorithm Signals (2026)
*   **Dwell Time**: Length of time spent on a post is crucial. Long-form text and carousels work best.
*   **Comments**: Early comments (first 60 mins) boost reach significantly.
*   **No Outlinks**: Links in comments are better than links in the post body (which penalty reach).

## Formats that Work

1.  **Text-Only (The "Broetry" Style)**
    *   Short, punchy sentences.
    *   Strong hook in the first 2 lines (before "See more").
    *   Space out paragraphs for readability on mobile.

2.  **PDF Carousels**
    *   High retention format.
    *   8-12 slides is the sweet spot.
    *   Slide 1: Title + Hook.
    *   Slide 2-N: Value.
    *   Last Slide: CTA.

3.  **Video**
    *   Upload NATIVELY (do not link YouTube).
    *   Captions are mandatory (80% watch on mute).

## Posting Cadence
*   **Frequency**: 3-5x per week is optimal. Consistency > Frequency.
*   **Time**: Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday mornings (8am-10am local time) are historically best for B2B.
