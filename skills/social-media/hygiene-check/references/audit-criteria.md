## Improvement Framework

When suggesting copy improvements, follow this process:

1. **Identify the Gap**
   - What's missing? (value prop, clarity, personality)
   - What's weak? (generic language, lack of focus)

2. **Understand the Brand**
   - Industry and audience
   - Desired tone and voice
   - Competitive differentiation

3. **Draft New Copy**
   - Lead with the most compelling point
   - Use active voice
   - Be specific (avoid generalities)
   - Include a subtle call-to-action when appropriate

4. **Refine**
   - Cut unnecessary words
   - Ensure keyword presence (for SEO)
   - Check character limits (Instagram: 150, LinkedIn tagline: 120, etc.)
   - Read aloud for flow

## Severity Classification

Use these levels when flagging issues:

- **Critical**: Missing essential information (contact details, broken links, no bio)
- **High**: Poor quality that significantly impacts brand perception (generic copy, low-res images)
- **Medium**: Optimization opportunities (missing keywords, lack of CTA)
- **Low**: Nice-to-haves (seasonal cover updates, highlight organization)
