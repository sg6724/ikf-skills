# Company Research Skill

Use this skill to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a target company. This is the foundation for all content strategy work.

## Process

1.  **Business Model Analysis**
    *   What does the company sell?
    *   How do they make money?
    *   Who are their primary customers (B2B/B2C)?

2.  **Product & Service Deep Dive**
    *   List key products/services.
    *   Identify "Hero" products.
    *   Analyze pricing strategy (if public).

3.  **Brand Identity**
    *   Analyze brand voice (Professional, Playful, Technical, educational?).
    *   Identify key messaging themes / slogans.
    *   Review visual identity comments (logo, colors - broadly).

4.  **Market Position**
    *   What is their Unique Value Proposition (UVP)?
    *   How do they differentiate from general competitors?

## Output Format
